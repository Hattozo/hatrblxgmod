These are Roblox ragdolls of people I know on Roblox ported to Garry's Mod. Credit to Tdp11 for using Rbx2Source to get these models since Rbx2Source wasn't working for me.
Most credit goes to CloneTrooper1019 for making Rbx2Source that ports Roblox ragdolls to Garry's Mod.
I could not get this on the Steam Workshop, so I am using GitHub to publish this addon instead.
